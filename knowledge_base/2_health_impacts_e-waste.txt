HEALTH & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF INFORMAL E‑WASTE RECYCLING

CHILDREN AS A CRITICAL GROUP
• WHO identifies more than 18 million children and 12 million women in low‑income countries engaged in informal e‑waste recycling.
• Prenatal exposure to lead, cadmium and PBDEs linked with low birth weight, stillbirth, premature birth, and neuro‑developmental delays.
• Elevated blood‑lead levels (>5 µg dL⁻¹) prevalent in children living near e‑waste sites in Guiyu (China), Agbogbloshie (Ghana) and Moradabad (India).

KEY TOXICANTS
• Metals – Lead (CRT glass, solder), mercury (switches, backlights), chromium VI (metal plating).
• POPs – PBDE flame retardants, dioxins from open‑burning insulating plastics.
• Acids – Hydrochloric & nitric used in “aqua‑regia” gold reclamation release toxic fumes.

PATHWAYS
1. Inhalation of fine particulate from burning cables and boards.
2. Dermal absorption during acid leaching.
3. Food‑chain: bio‑accumulation of heavy metals in rice grown in contaminated soils.

POLICY/TECHNICAL RESPONSES
• Shift to formal recycling with enclosures & negative‑pressure ventilation.
• Ban open burning and acid‑leaching; promote hydrometallurgical closed‑loop processes.
• Health surveillance and education programmes for local communities.
