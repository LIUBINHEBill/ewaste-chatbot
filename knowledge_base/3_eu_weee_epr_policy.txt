EU WEEE DIRECTIVE & EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY (EPR)

LEGISLATIVE TIMELINE
• 2003 – Original WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC created common EU rules.
• 2012 – Recast Directive 2012/19/EU; mandatory EPR and ambitious collection targets.
• 2020 – Collection target: 65 % of average weight of EEE placed on market, or 85 % of WEEE generated.

CORE EPR OBLIGATIONS
1. Producers finance collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE.
2. Free take‑back for households (“1:1” rule, later “1:0” for small WEEE ≤ 25 cm).
3. Information flow – Producers must mark products with crossed‑out wheeled bin, provide dismantling manuals.

PERFORMANCE
• 2021 EU average collection rate: 42.8 %; leading countries (Croatia, Bulgaria, Poland) > 75 %; laggards (Romania, Cyprus) < 20 %.
• Recovery targets by category (e.g., 85 % for large appliances) mostly met in high‑performing states.

CHALLENGES & NEXT STEPS
• Missing flows (online free‑riders, illegal exports) undermine statistics.
• Commission reviewing “Right‑to‑Repair” directive to complement EPR.
• Digital Product Passport (from 2027) will improve traceability and recyclability data.
