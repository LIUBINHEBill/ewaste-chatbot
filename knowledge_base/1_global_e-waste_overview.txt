GLOBAL E‑WASTE TRENDS (2024)

• Definition – E‑waste is any discarded product with a plug, battery or cable.
• Generation – 62 million t in 2022, up 82 % since 2010.
• Collection & recycling – Only 22.3 % (13.8 Mt) formally collected in 2022; forecast to drop to 20 % by 2030 if policies stagnate (Global E‑waste Monitor 2024).
• Drivers of growth – Shorter device lifecycles, higher consumption, limited repairability (“electronification” of society).
• Regional picture – Europe has the highest documented collection rate (42.8 %), Africa the lowest (1.5 %).
• Material value – The embedded raw‑material value was USD 62 billion in 2022, dominated by copper, gold, and rare earth elements.
• Climate link – Recycling the 2022 “hidden” copper alone could avoid ~10 Mt CO₂‑eq compared with primary mining.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. The volume of e‑waste is rising five times faster than documented recycling.
2. Closing the collection gap offers a triple win: resource security, carbon savings, and toxicity reduction.
3. Policy acceleration (EPR, right‑to‑repair, repairability scoring) and investment in formal recycling infrastructure are critical before 2030.
