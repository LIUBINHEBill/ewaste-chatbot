MODULAR DESIGN CASE STUDY – FAIRPHONE 4

DEVICE OVERVIEW
• Launch: Oct‑2021; first 5G modular smartphone.
• Architecture: 8 easily replaceable modules (display, cameras, USB‑C port, battery, etc.) fastened by Phillips screws – no glue.

LCA INSIGHTS (Fraunhofer IZM 2022)
• Baseline cradle‑to‑grave carbon footprint: 70 kg CO₂‑eq (6 GB/128 GB version).
• Extending device lifetime from global avg. 2.7 yrs to 5 yrs ↓ footprint by 31 %.
• Battery replacement once at 2.5 yrs yields additional 8 % reduction vs buying new.

MATERIAL FAIRNESS
• Fairtrade gold in supply chain since FP3; FP4 adds Fair Cobalt Alliance participation.
• 100 % recycled tin, rare‑earth magnets and tungsten in key components.

REPAIR ECONOMICS
• Display swap ≈ 90 s / €79; battery swap ≈ 20 s / €29.
• iFixit repairability score 10/10 – highest in industry.

ECOSYSTEM IMPACT
• Influenced EU Right‑to‑Repair debate; cited by French Repairability Index methodology.
• Demonstrates commercial viability of modular, repairable design.
